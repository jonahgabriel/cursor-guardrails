# Poetry Enforcement Rules

## Required Structure

- All Python packages must use Poetry for dependency management
- Each container must have a `pyproject.toml` file in its root directory
- No `requirements.txt` or `setup.py` files are allowed

## pyproject.toml Requirements

- Must include complete project metadata:
  ```toml
  [tool.poetry]
  name = "container-name"
  version = "0.1.0"
  description = "Container purpose description"
  authors = ["Project Maintainer <maintainer@project.example>"]
  readme = "README.md"
  ```
