# Documentation Rules

## Required Documentation Files

- README.md in project root and each container
- CONTRIBUTING.md for contribution guidelines
- CHANGELOG.md for version history

## Strategic Documentation Types

- Block documentation (e.g., BLOCK1_FOUNDATION.md)
  - Must include Overview, Components, Implementation Status, and Integration Points
  - Use checkboxes [x] for completed items, [ ] for pending items
  - Document specific Next Steps and Roadmap

- Strategy documents (e.g., LLM_TRAINING_STRATEGY.md, OPTIMIZATION_STRATEGY.md)
  - Must include Overview, Objectives, and Implementation Details
  - Should include concrete code examples where relevant
  - Must align with technical implementation

- Planning documents (e.g., GTM_PLAN.md)
  - Must include phased approach with clear timelines
  - Include measurable goals and KPIs
  - Document resource requirements

## Code Documentation

- Python docstrings:
  - Use Google style docstrings
  - Required sections: Args, Returns, Raises, Examples
  - Use type hints in all function signatures

- Special docstring annotations:
  ```python
  /**
   * @docCategory Foundation
   * @implementationStatus complete
   * @integrates Block2, Block5
   * 
   * Service responsible for message routing between nodes.
   */
  ```

## Documentation Organization

- docs/ - Root documentation directory
  - Block documentation (BLOCK*_*.md)
  - Strategy documents (*_STRATEGY.md, *_PLAN.md)
  - development/ - Development guidelines
  - api/ - API documentation

## Formatting Standards

- Line length: 120 characters maximum
- Code blocks must specify language
- Use relative links for cross-references
- Tables must have headers and proper alignment
- Document all acronyms on first use
