# Host and Project Root Protection Rules

1. **No Direct Host Installations**:
   - Do not execute or suggest installation commands that modify the host system
   - This includes `apt-get`, `brew`, `npm install -g`, `pip install` without virtual environments
   - Always ask before suggesting any system-wide package installation

2. **Project Root Protection**:
   - Do not modify core configuration files in the project root without explicit permission
   - Protected files include but are not limited to:
     - package.json, requirements.txt
     - Dockerfile, docker-compose.yml
     - .env, .gitignore
     - Any hidden configuration files (.*) 

3. **Required Approach**:
   - When suggesting changes to protected files or system, explicitly ask for permission
   - Present the changes you want to make and wait for explicit confirmation
   - Suggest using isolated environments (venvs, containers) when possible

These rules ensure system stability and prevent unexpected changes to critical project infrastructure.
